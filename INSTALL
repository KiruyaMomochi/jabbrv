===Basic Installation===
No installation is necessary, simply work in the same folder as the LaTeX style
file (jabbrv.sty), the language definition files (*.ldf) and the BibTeX style
files (*.bst).  Include the package by using \usepackage{jabbrv} in your LaTeX
preamble and enable the package functionality by setting the BibTeX
bibliography style to one of the following choices (depending on the desired
bibliography format):
	* jabbrv_abbrv
	* jabbrv_acm
	* jabbrv_alpha
	* jabbrv_ieeetr
	* jabbrv_plain
	* jabbrv_siam
	* jabbrv_unsrt

===Global Installation===
To attempt an automated global installation first open a terminal and change
the directory to the extracted jabbrv folder. Next, run the install script by
executing:
sudo ./install.sh

If the script cannot detect your local LaTeX installation folder, then you may
pass a custom install directory like so:
sudo ./install.sh /usr/local/share/texmf
Please note that the chosen folder must be part of the directory tree recognized
by your LaTeX installation, otherwise the package will note be properly detected.

===Using Other Styles===
If you wish to use a style outside of the base BibTeX package then you need to
modify that style to call jabbrv.  Start by copying the BibTeX style you wish
to use to your working folder (and rename it appropriately).  Next open the
style file and search for:
	"journal" output.check
This line is usually formatted like so (sometimes with an open bracket at
the beginning of the line):
	journal emphasis "journal" output.check
Replace this line (do not replace the open bracket if there is one) with:
	format.journal "journal" output.check
Then add the following code somewhere outside of the listed functions (above
the "article" function you're currently editing is fine):
	FUNCTION {format.journal}
	{
	  "{\em\JournalTitle{" journal * "}}" *
	}
Please note that if the line you replaced used some other formatting (we
started with an emphasized entry, corresponding to the "\em" command) then you
will need to change the formatting in the above function.  Once you have done
this step you should be all set, just follow the basic installation
instructions above.

===LyX Notes===
The preamble may be modified by choosing "Settings" from the "Documents" menu
and then selecting "LaTeX Preamble" from the menu on the left.
